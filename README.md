# 🔍 What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that integrates software development and IT operations to improve collaboration, automate processes, and enable the continuous delivery of high-quality software with greater speed, reliability, and scalability.

# 🔩 What does DevOps comprise?

DevOps majorly consists of following areas- 

- ⏳ Version Control System
- 🐳 Containers
- ☸️ Container Orchestration tools
- 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code
- ⚙️ Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
- 🚀 GitOps

# ⏳ Version Control System

## Git 

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development, enabling multiple developers to collaborate efficiently, manage code history, and maintain different versions of a project.

## GitHub

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for version control, collaboration, code review, issue tracking, and continuous integration, enabling teams to develop, manage, and share software projects efficiently.

# 🐳 Docker Containers

Docker lets you run applications in isolated environments, independent of the operating system. So that we don't need to test our application in all kinds of operating systems and runtimes.

Core areas to focus on - 

🔹 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹𝘀 
🔹 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 & 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲𝘀
🔹 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝘀i𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀
🔹 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲 
🔹 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸
🔹 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗩𝗼𝗹𝘂𝗺𝗲
🔹 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗕𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀

👉 For complete hand written notes on Docker, please check [Docker Notes](./Docker)

# 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of defining and managing infrastructure using code instead of manual processes. Servers, networks, databases, and cloud resources are described in machine-readable configuration files and provisioned automatically.

Terrform is one of the most poplular IaC tool.

Core areas to focus on - 

🔹 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹𝘀 
🔹 𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀
🔹 𝗛𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗽 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗴 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲(𝗛𝗖𝗟)
🔹 𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄(𝘃𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲, 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻, 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝘆)
🔹 𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀
🔹 𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲𝘀
🔹 𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲𝘀 
🔹 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲𝘀

👉 For complete hand written notes on Terraform, please check [Terraform Notes](./IaC)

# ⚙️ Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery 

## Github Actions

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform that allows developers to automate software workflows directly within GitHub repositories, including building, testing, and deploying code in response to events such as commits, pull requests, and releases.
